API Project
Description
This project demonstrates how to access and export employee data from an API into various data structures using Python scripts. It emphasizes the limitations of Bash scripting for such tasks and introduces modern approaches for System Administrators, particularly using APIs, JSON, and CSV formats.

Key Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

What tasks Bash scripting should not handle
What an API and a REST API are
Microservices and their relevance
The CSV and JSON formats
Pythonic naming conventions and coding styles (PEP8)
Resources
